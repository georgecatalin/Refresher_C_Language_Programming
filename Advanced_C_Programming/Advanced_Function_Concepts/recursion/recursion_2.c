/*
It goes "back" to `up_and_down(5)` because of how recursion and the call stack work in C.

When `up_and_down(5)` calls `up_and_down(6)`, the program temporarily leaves `up_and_down(5)` and starts executing `up_and_down(6)`. When `up_and_down(6)` finishes (because it doesn't recurse further), the program returns to where it left off in `up_and_down(5)`â€”specifically, right after the recursive call.

This is called "unwinding the stack": each function call waits for the next one to finish before it can continue. So after `up_and_down(6)` returns, the code in `up_and_down(5)` after the recursive call runs (the second printf), and then it returns to `up_and_down(4)`, and so on, all the way back to `main`.

This is why you see the "coming down" print statements for each number as the recursion unwinds.
