/*
fprintf() is a standard C library function used to write formatted text to a file.

Think of the regular printf() function, which prints formatted text to your console (the screen). 
The f in fprintf() stands for "file"â€”it does the exact same thing as printf(), but instead of printing to the screen, 
it writes to a file you specify. 

Signature:
int fprintf(FILE * file_stream, const char * format,...)

- FILE *stream: This is a pointer to a FILE object. It's essentially the destination where you want to write your text. 
You typically get this pointer from the fopen() function.
- const char *format: This is the template string that defines how your data should be formatted. It contains regular 
text and special placeholders called format specifiers (e.g., %d, %s).
- ... (ellipsis): These are the variables (e.g., numbers, strings) that will replace the format specifiers in the template string.

The function returns the number of characters successfully written, or a negative number if an error occurs.
